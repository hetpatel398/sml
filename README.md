# sml

* This repository contains some sml code which I wrote in my initial days learning sml.

* This repository also contains code to find factorial of any number using [multiplication algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karatsuba_algorithm) in sml. In this code intermidiate product of numbers can become very large that's why I have represented number in list of digits in base 10^4 (i.e. 4 digits in each elements of the list).
